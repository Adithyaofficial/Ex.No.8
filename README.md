## Exp 8: Reproducing an Image Using Prompts for Image Generation

# Date : 19.09.2025
# Reg. No : 212223220002

## Aim:
To demonstrate the ability of text-to-image generation tools to reproduce an existing image by crafting precise prompts. The goal is to identify key elements within the image and use these details to generate an image as close as possible to the original.

# AI tools required :

1.ChatGPT / Any LLM for prompt crafting

2.AI Audio Generator (e.g., ElevenLabs Sound Effects, Stability Audio, Adobe Audio AI)

## Procedure:

# 1.Define the Role

You are a professional sound designer AI that generates realistic Foley sound effects for film production.


# 2.Describe the Sound

Generate a realistic audio clip of a glass bottle shattering on a wooden floor.


# 3.Add Details for Realism

Capture the sharp high-pitched crack of breaking glass, followed by fragments scattering on wood with natural echo.


# 4.Enhance Technical Quality

The sound should have stereo depth, wooden resonance, and last 3â€“5 seconds.

# 5.Generate Sounds :
Run the prompt into the chosen AI audio generator.

# 6.Verify the Output

Check if the audio has:

Sharp crack of glass

Shards scattering on wood

Stereo depth and natural decay

# Prompt :

Situation :
You are a professional sound designer creating high-fidelity audio for a short film, focusing on capturing an authentic and immersive sound effect of a glass bottle shattering on a wooden floor.

Task :
Generate a precise, high-quality audio sample of a glass bottle shattering that meets professional sound design standards for film production.

Objective :
Create a sound effect that is sonically accurate, emotionally impactful, and technically pristine, enhancing the narrative and sensory experience of the film.

Knowledge :

Sound Characteristics:
Object: Glass bottle
Breaking Mechanism: Complete, instantaneous shattering
Surface: Wooden floor with natural acoustic properties
Desired Qualities:
Hyper-realistic texture
Sharp initial impact
Deep, resonant undertones
Multi-layered sound profile
Technical Specifications:
High-resolution audio capture
Minimum 48kHz sampling rate
Wide dynamic range
Minimal digital artifacts

Examples :

Reference professional foley techniques used in films like "Inception" or "No Country for Old Men"
Aim for a sound that captures both the brittle glass fracture and the wooden surface's acoustic response
Critically analyze every sonic detail. Your audio generation must be so precise that it could be mistaken for a real-world recording. Prioritize authenticity, depth, and emotional resonance in the sound design.


## Conclusion:
By using detailed and well-crafted prompts, text-to-sound generation models can be effective in reproducing an audio closely. The quality of the generated audio's depends on how accurately the prompt describes the audio's key elements. The experiment demonstrates the importance of prompt refinement and iteration when working with AI tools to achieve desired outcomes. With practice, the model can generate audio that closely match real-world sounds, which is useful for creative and practical applications.
